# This file is intentionally empty but required for directory structure.
# The actual provider manifests are in aws-provider.yaml and provider-config.yaml
# 
# Sync order is controlled by annotations:
# 1. aws-provider.yaml (wave 1) - Installs Provider CRDs
# 2. provider-config.yaml (wave 2) - Creates ProviderConfig (requires Provider CRDs)
